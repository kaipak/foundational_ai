# AlexNet
AlexNet is a convolutional neural network that is trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The network is 8 layers deep and can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. As a result, the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images. 
The network has an image input size of 227-by-227.
